        The Simpsons: Tapped Out (TSTO), or simply known as Tapped Out, is a freemium licensed city-building mobile game for iOS and Android, based on the American animated comedy television series The Simpsons. It allows users to create and maintain their own version of Springfield using familiar characters and buildings. The game is regularly updated with new content, often seasonal and holiday-themed, for example, during holidays like Thanksgiving, and Treehouse of Horror episodes-related content for Halloween. The game is available in several languages such as English, French, Turkish, Italian, German, Simplified Chinese, Peninsular Spanish and both European Portuguese and Brazilian Portuguese. The game was developed and published by EA Mobile and launched in Europe on February 29, 2012 and in North America on March 1, 2012 for iOS[1] and February 6, 2013 for Android.[2] The game was released for Amazon Fire devices in several markets on June 24, 2013.[3]

        According to its own estimates, EA generated over $130 million in revenue since the game's release, as of 2014.[4]

        On September 26, 2024, Electronic Arts announced that Tapped Out would be delisted from the App Store and Google Play on October 31, 2024, while users who have the app downloaded would be able to continue playing the game until January 24, 2025, after which the game would be permanently discontinued.[5]

        Too busy playing a Happy Little Elves-themed game on his myPad at work, Homer Simpson neglects his workstation and accidentally causes a meltdown at the nuclear power plant, leading to the complete destruction of Springfield. Left stranded, he is solely responsible for rebuilding Springfield and bringing back its town members. Homer is desperate to find other characters so that he can get them to rebuild, and he can get back to his elf game. With the help of Lisa, Homer rebuilds Springfield and brings back key sought-out characters.

      <h2>Gameplay</h2>
      <p>
        The Simpsons: Tapped Out is a city-building game.[6] It offers buildings that the player buys with "Money ($)" in-game currency. Premium items are bought with Donuts which can also be purchased with real-world cash. The player uses building and characters to make progress. By completing quests and levels, the player collects more characters and buildings to unlock more quests and levels. Each building generates in-game money to collect, under names such as "Income tax" from houses and the "Marking up Prices" for the Kwik-E-Mart. Players can place rivers, roads, pavement and decorations on the land.

The game is supported by EA's Origin, which acts as a social bridge to where players log into their Origin accounts and visit friends' towns to collect cash every 24 hours.

Since the May 18, 2016 update, the maximum number of levels is 939. This is a reference to the episode "A Tale of Two Springfields", which shows the Simpsons' area code.

Content updates have been released for the game, with new game content or limited-time events related to episode promotions or holidays. Major events include a temporary currency, which win the player limited edition prizes.[7][8]

            According to game runner and longtime Simpsons writer J. Stewart Burns, the game originally started as a "labor of love" and he didn't expect much to happen after the game's release.[6] Although they do not get credited, there are about diez writers who currently work on the game, including Simpsons writers Burns, Matt Selman, Brian Kelley, Jeff Westbrook, Jon Kern, Carolyn Omine and Diana Wright.[6]
